Summary:
Given the dataset, "medical_examination.csv", plot a bar graph and a confusion matrix.

medical_data_visualizer.py - contains the relevant code I created
test_module.py - contains the test cases

What I learned:
 - introduction to the seaborn and matplot libraries
 - first time plotting graphs of any kind using python
