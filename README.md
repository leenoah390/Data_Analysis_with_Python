## Context ##
Prior to this, my only expierence using Python was a class at MSU from spring of 2021. Since then, all my coding-based classes have been focused on R, with the exception of a summer class this year (2023) that finished up about a month ago. As a result, I realized that I really needed to brush up, review, and re-learn Python so I can get back to the level of comfortableness I had in 2021.
