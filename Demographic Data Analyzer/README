# Project 2: Demographic Data Analyzer

See link below for an in-depth explanation for the objectives:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer

Summary:
Given the dataset, "adult.datata.csv", create code to answer questions using math and pandas.

demographic_data_analyzer.py - contains the relevant code I created
test_module.py - contains the test cases
adult.data.csv - dataset needed for code to run


What I learned:
 - pandas library is completely new to me... never used it before
 - Had to look at the pandas website and YouTube videos a lot to get familiar with the many functions
 - working with datasets in python is also new to me. I am much more familiar with R, so I had some trouble with small stuff such as:
      - Variable$column_name vs Variable['column_name']
 - this project was harder than the previous, but also showed how helpful knowing pandas can be for data analysis
